# Comparative Analysis of SVoD Services
A comprehensive data analysis project designed to evaluate various subscription-based video on demand (SVoD) services based on their content library, cost, and ratings.

## Motivation
With over 200 streaming services available, it can be challenging for consumers, especially those low on a budget, to find one that best fits their needs. This project compares four major streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+) to help users determine which platform offers the best overall value, quality, and content for different needs and budgets.

## Datasets
